  <p>
  This work proposes a new theoretical framework to explain anomalous
  interstellar objects such as ʻOumuamua, focusing on fracture-induced
  dynamics and non-gravitational acceleration.
  </p>
<p>
ʻOumuamua (1I/2017), the first confirmed interstellar object observed
passing through the Solar System, exhibited a combination of physical
and dynamical properties that challenge conventional classifications
as either a comet or an asteroid. These include its extreme elongation,
absence of a detectable coma, chaotic tumbling motion, neutral
reflectance spectrum, and the presence of a small but measurable
non-gravitational acceleration.
</p>

<p>
The Exotic Fracture Object (EFO) Theory proposes that ʻOumuamua belongs
to a distinct class of naturally occurring interstellar fragments
produced during violent stellar-scale events. Such events may include
tidal disruption near stars, supernova shock–driven fragmentation, or
extreme hypervelocity collisions between solid bodies. In these
environments, catastrophic mechanical failure can generate thin,
structurally robust, and volatile-depleted fragments with unusually
high area-to-mass ratios.
</p>

<p>
The EFO framework therefore introduces a physically motivated and
self-consistent explanation for the full set of observed anomalies,
without invoking fine-tuned assumptions or artificial origins. More
broadly, it suggests the existence of a previously unrecognized
population of interstellar debris shaped by extreme astrophysical
processes.
</p>

</p>
Fun Fact – it is nor really related with the general framework 
but all of this anamolies are neutralized by only a teenager who is just 14 years old.
Really he broke the back of the beast.
