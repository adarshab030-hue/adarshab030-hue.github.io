  <h3>Exotic Fracture Object (EFO)</h3>

    A unified theoretical framework explaining all major anomalies of 
    ʻOumuamua (1I/2017).

  <h2>What is the Exotic Fracture Object (EFO) Theory?</h2>

  <p>
    The Exotic Fracture Object (EFO) Theory is a scientific explanation
    proposed to understand the unusual interstellar object
    ʻOumuamua (1I/2017), which passed through our Solar System in 2017.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike typical comets or asteroids, ʻOumuamua showed several strange
    behaviors: it had an extremely elongated shape, showed no visible
    comet tail, rotated chaotically, and experienced a small but
    measurable acceleration without any detected gas release.
  </p>

  <p>
    The EFO Theory suggests that ʻOumuamua is a natural fragment formed
    during violent stellar events such as supernova shock waves, tidal
    disruption near stars, or high-energy collisions between planetary
    bodies. These extreme events can break solid material into thin,
    strong, and volatile-poor fragments unlike objects normally found
    in our Solar System.
  </p>

  <p>
    According to this idea, ʻOumuamua’s motion can be explained by subtle
    surface-level forces — such as thermal desorption or radiation-driven
    effects — rather than traditional cometary outgassing. This allows
    the object to accelerate without producing a visible coma.
  </p>

  <p>
    The EFO framework introduces a new category of interstellar objects,
    expanding our understanding of how planetary systems evolve and how
    extreme astrophysical processes shape solid matter across the galaxy.
